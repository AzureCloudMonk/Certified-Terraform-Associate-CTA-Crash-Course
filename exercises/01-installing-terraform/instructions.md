# Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will install the Terraform binary on your machine. Afterward, you will run commands to verify that the installation is functional.

1. Install the latest Terraform binary on your machine. Choose the most fitting [installation method](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) based on operating system and personal preference.
2. Run the command `terraform version` to determine the version of the executable.
3. Run the command `terraform -help` and explore the output.
4. [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you are planning to interact with the cloud provider for the exercises in this course. In your shell, export the AWS credentials with the relevant environment variables. Ignore this step if you are already set up with AWS.
5. Install an IDE or editor of your choice plus the corresponding Terraform plugin/extension.
