# Prerequisites

Exercises will require the tooling listed below. Ensure that all of those tools have been installed before attending the training if you want to follow along. The training does not reserve time for setting up or verifying the installed tools or their respective versions.

## Technical Requirements

* A computer with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed. Should you have to manage multiple Terraform versions on a single machine in parallel, the tool [tfswitch](https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/) might come in handy.
* A code editor to write and modify configuration files; instructor will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) installed (other IDEs, like IDEA with the Terraform plugin installed, may work as well)
* A [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to interact with a GitHub repository
* An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and credentials for creating or modifying resources during the exercises. _Note:_ Running Terraform commands for AWS to create resources may accrue a small cost. You can opt out of running the command during the exercise.

## Skills

* An understanding of basic programming concepts (e.g., variables and functions)
* The need for defining infrastructure as code
* Familiarity with Unix command-line tools like wget, curl, or tar
